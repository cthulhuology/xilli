xilli
------

xilli linux is a pragmatic linux distribution designed to be:
	
	* simple
	* understandable
	* manageable
	* and command line friendly

more information about xilli linux will be found at the website

	http://xil.li/

right now xilli is in an experimental stage, and has only just the
basic bootstrap environment created. 


getting started
---------------

to create a bootstrap image:

* sudo tools/create-xilli-user
* sudo tools/make-tools
* make
* sudo tools/make-image
* sudo tools/make-directories
* sudo tools/copy-config
* sudo cp -R /tools/* root/tools/
* sudo tools/mount-system
* sudo tools/chroot

this will create a new user on your system,
create a /tools top level directory for the x86_64 cross compiler
build the basic system utilities
create a 10GB ext4 file system image and mount it via loopback
create the system directories in the image
copy over a minimal /etc configuration 
copy over the cross compiler and system tools
create some devices and mount the kernel mount points
chroot into the environment

after you're inside you might want to create some basic symlinks 
by copying and pasting the tools/make-links script into the 
new environment.


roadmap
-------

in no particular order the plans for xilli linux are:

* get a UEFI boot image working on a USB stick
* clean up the build system to be all in makefiles
* get X11 cross compiled and working
* compile a bunch of utilities for everyday use
* implement xish shell
* customize the kernel to work on my hardware
* port cross compiler to ARM
